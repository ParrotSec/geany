Description: fast and lightweight IDE
 Geany is a small and lightweight integrated development environment.
 It was developed to provide a small and fast IDE, which has only a
 few dependencies from other packages. It is using only the GTK2 toolkit
 and therefore you need only the GTK2 runtime libraries to run Geany.
 .
 The basic features of Geany are:
  - syntax highlighting
  - code completion
  - auto completion of constructs like if, for and while, XML and HTML
  - call tips
  - folding
  - many supported filetypes like C, Java, PHP, HTML, Python, Perl, Pascal
  - symbol lists
  - embedded terminal emulation
