geany (0.11-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Tab is now used for construct completion (for, if, etc.), but
  it is configurable with the new 'Complete construct' keybinding.

  Template files are now stored in ~/.geany/templates/ and the 'template.'
  filename prefix is no longer used. You will need to move any custom
  template files you have.

  Inserting a file header is now optional for filetype templates.  Use the
  string '{fileheader}' to mark where the file header should be placed.

  Drag'n'Drop of text inside the editor widget will now move the text
  instead of copying it.
